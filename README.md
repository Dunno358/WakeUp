That is my first ever python project, so code is not following SOLID and is very badly written.
# WakeUp
This is a Pygame application that lets you set reminders for specific dates and times. The application works with Windows Task Scheduler, and it also allows you to customize the look and sound of your reminders.
## requirements
- pygame installed
> pip install pygame
- Administrator account might be needed
- Windows 7 or above
# Possiblities
## Task scheduling
You can easily set a reminder on your device at specific date and time(hh:mm:ss) with a note if needed.
## Customization
- Colors - You can choose from 21 colors to fill one of three segments of app, which lets you mix them different ways.
- Background and side pictures - You can choose from preloaded 8 pictures for both background and side bar. If you want you can add your own pictures to specified folder and use them as well.
- Music - You can choose if you want your reminders with or without music. But if you chose to turn music on, you can choose from 8 different music sounds for every alarm.
